Which of the following lines in the sshd configuration file should, if present, be changed in order to increase the security of the server? (Choose two.)
A. Protocol 2, 1
B. PermitEmptyPasswords no
C. Port 22
D. PermitRootLogin yes
E. IgnoreRhosts yes

Correct Answer: AD

Erkl√§rung:
A. Protocol 2, 1

Diese Einstellung sollte zu "Protocol 2" ge√§ndert werden.
SSH Protokoll 1 ist veraltet und unsicher. Es hat bekannte Schwachstellen.
Nur Protokoll 2 sollte verwendet werden, da es sicherer ist und bessere Verschl√ºsselung bietet.

D. PermitRootLogin yes

Diese Einstellung sollte auf "no" oder "prohibit-password" ge√§ndert werden.
Das direkte Einloggen als Root √ºber SSH stellt ein Sicherheitsrisiko dar.
Es ist besser, sich als normaler Benutzer einzuloggen und dann bei Bedarf zu Root zu wechseln.
